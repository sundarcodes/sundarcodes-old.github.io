    <p>Absolutely loving every minute of this boot camp.. For a guy who was looking for some time to invest on himself in becoming a better programmer,
this is a blessing..It was just what I wanted. Each one gets a curriculum designed to match his/her interests and finally alligned to make you a better progammer and a web app developer.
</p>
<h3>So where do we get started to become better programmers ? </h3>
<p> Knowing your data structures and algorithms is the first and most essential step in becoming a quality developer, no matter whatever technology or language you are working on. Hackerrank, Codility are excellent for this..Hackerrank is a good place to get your hands dirty and they have a ranking concept to keep you on your toes. More you solve, higher the rankings. Hackerrank has a very good collection of problems across variuos domains especially in the alogorithm and data structures section. Codility is like a tough nut to crack. Not only they expect your solution to be right for all cases, but they also want it to fit in the worse case Time and Space Complexity they specify. So its taking your solutions to the next level where they check how efficient it is in terms of time and space management. </p>
<p>The idea behind knowing your algorithms and data structures is not to just clear the interviews and to show that you know it, its all about learning the essence of the technique used in desiging the algorithm. This will help us in giving us different techniques to approach a problem. If you look at the quick sort or merge sort problem, they are based on breaking a problem into smaller pieces and solving them recursively. This technique called Divide and Conquer can be applied to lot of other cases in real-life. </p>

<strong>Bottom Line</strong>: <em>Know your algorithms and data structures first !! </em>
