        <title>Is Javascript Asynchronous ?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really puzzled when I came across the term - &quot;Asynchronous Javascript&quot;.. WTF I know Javascript engine is a single threaded environment
where only one task is executed at a time..But when I saw so many articles on this and in particular lot of frameworks/runtimes like node.js,io.js relying on the asynchronous bahviour provided by Javascript, I really wanted to dig further and understand how a single thread can work asynchronously or in a concurrent fashion but still maintaining the sequencing and dependencies of the executing statements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few responses in stackoverflow did answer my queries but I was still not convinced 100%. I had a very simple question in my mind -- Assume I have the following javascript snippet &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;callBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;In call back&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setTimeOut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;callBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;After call Back&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output of the program as expected would be &quot;After call Back&quot; followed by &quot;In call back&quot;. Everyone who have programmed Javascript would know that setTimeout() takes a callback function and executes it after the timeout interval specified has ellapsed. The callback is called after 3 seconds (3000 ms) has passed. I understood that there will be an event triggered at the end 3 seconds and the call back would be executed by the javascript runtime. I first thougt javascript would have a timer mechanism built inside the setTimeout() function code and it will trigger the call back function after it had expired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; My doubt was which part of the Javascript engine would handle the timing out functionality as I know the main thread (or &quot;The Thread&quot;) of the JS engine would not do this as it is not going to block.I was very interested to look at the setTimeOut functionality source code but couldn&#39;t find it. My curiousity was killing me and I landed upon this heck of an video which had answers to all that was running on my mind... Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&quot;&gt;Philip Roberts&lt;/a&gt;..You had made my day :) &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Python Vs Ruby</title>
        <description>To be updated during the course of bootcamp..once I get to know Ruby well and match it against Python

        <title>Life@CodeAstra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Absolutely loving every minute of this boot camp.. For a guy who was looking for some time to invest on himself in becoming a better programmer,
this is a blessing..It was just what I wanted. Each one gets a curriculum designed to match his/her interests and finally alligned to make you a better progammer and a web app developer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So where do we get started to become better programmers ? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Knowing your data structures and algorithms is the first and most essential step in becoming a quality developer, no matter whatever technology or language you are working on. Hackerrank, Codility are excellent for this..Hackerrank is a good place to get your hands dirty and they have a ranking concept to keep you on your toes. More you solve, higher the rankings. Hackerrank has a very good collection of problems across variuos domains especially in the alogorithm and data structures section. Codility is like a tough nut to crack. Not only they expect your solution to be right for all cases, but they also want it to fit in the worse case Time and Space Complexity they specify. So its taking your solutions to the next level where they check how efficient it is in terms of time and space management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind knowing your algorithms and data structures is not to just clear the interviews and to show that you know it, its all about learning the essence of the technique used in desiging the algorithm. This will help us in giving us different techniques to approach a problem. If you look at the quick sort or merge sort problem, they are based on breaking a problem into smaller pieces and solving them recursively. This technique called Divide and Conquer can be applied to lot of other cases in real-life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Know your algorithms and data structures first !! &lt;/em&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Object Oriented Programming</title>
        <description>This is my first attempt at a technical blog or any blog for that matter.

So what is Object Oriented programming ?
It is an approach towards designing a solution to a problem by modelling to the problem context.In other words, you would be designing the solution to a problem by actually identifying the participants, their interactions and having them as objects in your design. Your design should replicate what the objects in the problem should/can do.

Let us take an example :
Problem Context :
