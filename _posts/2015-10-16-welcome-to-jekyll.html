Absolutely loving every minute of this boot camp.. For a guy who was looking for some time to invest on himself in becoming a better programmer,
this is a blessing..It was just what I wanted. Knowing your data structures, algorithms is the first and most essential step in becoming a quality
developer, no matter whatever technology or language you are working on. Hackerrank, Codility are excellent for this..
